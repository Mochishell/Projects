Drug usage has also shown to correlate to higher rates of Hepatitis A.  As humans, we need to eat and drink, and knowing that Hepatitis A can spread through environmental conditions led us to believe that areas that aren’t as strictly regulated will indeed have higher outbreaks of Hepatitis A.  By correlating drug usage and Hepatitis A, we can support the idea of higher drug regulation in order to reduce potential outbreaks. \n",

In addition to knowing the specifics of Hepatitis A, NNDSS(National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System) have compiled a history of Hepatitis A cases that have occurred throughout the years. This dataset will hopefully help us find a correlation with current occurrences of Hepatitis A in the U.S. \n",

This also means that the economy and infrastructure of an area in the data set could have changed drastically since 1916, again leading to the idea that the data may not be reflective of current conditions."

    "Studying the data would give us a better insight of future cases that could occur in potential states. If our analyses align our hypothesis, hopefully this will convince the state(s) to be more aware of hepatitis cases, and concentrate their efforts to help reduces cases.  If our methods of data visualization and analysis don’t work, we could try using different datasets. We could also see what exactly went wrong with our current methods to correct them. If our hypothesis is wrong, we can analyze the reasons why, which could be problems with either our data, our data analysis, or even our methods of cleaning the data, which could have led to skewed results. Depending on how much time we have, we could even do a new project with the same dataset that uses the results from this project to make more conclusions.\n",

    "Potential problems that could lead to errors during our study would most likely occur with the data itself. Because our dataset ranges from the years 1916 to 2010, our results may not align with the current conditions of Hepatitis A cases seen today. Another possible pitfall would be the massive outbreak of Hepatitis A cases that occurred in 2017(according to CDC), which could potentially affect our results. Lastly, the potential of a new problem that we wouldn’t consider(ex. New outbreak because of stress/medication/vaccines/contact with animals) could also affect the dataset. "
